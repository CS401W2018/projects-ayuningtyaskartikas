            <p> I’ve always been drawn to Pokemon because they’re just so cute! I first discovered them through the animated series, where I watched Ash’s adventures and couldn’t help but fall in love with all the quirky creatures. The Pokemon world was full of surprises, and the characters were so relatable, from the strong, determined Pikachu to the more mischievous ones like Meowth.</p>
            <p>Watching the show, I got so hooked on the idea of having my own Pokemon and going on epic adventures, just like Ash. It was like entering a world where all these adorable creatures could become my friends. When I started playing Pokemon GO, I found some of my favorites Pokemon, like Bulbasaur, Pikachu and Squirtle.</p>
