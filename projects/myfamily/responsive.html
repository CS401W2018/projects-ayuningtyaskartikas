                                <p>Riley used to be a happy and silly child, but as she entered her pre-teen years, she began to feel more insecure and inferior. Her move to San Francisco made her feel even lonelier, and she found it difficult to deal with her emotions. The change was overwhelming, but over time, she learned to open up and express her emotions to her family, which eventually helped her accept the changes in her life..</p>

Although she can be frustrated by her husband's cluelessness, she still loves him and tries her best to support her daughter, Riley. Jill's compassion and ability to empathize with others comes from her deep understanding of emotions, perhaps shaped by her own experiences. She is always there for the people she loves.</p>
