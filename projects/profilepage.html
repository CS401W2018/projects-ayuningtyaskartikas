    <h1>Ayu Ningtyas Kartika Sari (Tika)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Aloha! I am Ayu Ningtyas Kartika Sari from <mark>Jakarta, Indonesia</mark> pursuing a degree in <em>Computer Science</em> at Brigham Young University-Hawaii with minors in <em>Marketing</em> &amp; <em>Visual Arts</em>. Since childhood, I have been recognized as a critical yet sentimental individual, always intrigued by the questions of 'why' things happen and 'how' they work. I believe that everything in the world is interconnected and has <strong>unique patterns.</strong></p>
    
    <p>My current focus lies in exploring technology, art, and human relationships. However, my ultimate aspiration is to address real-world challenges and contribute to build a better world for all.</p>
    <p>5 Things I love to do in my leisure time:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <p><li>Playing Pingpong</li></p>
        <p><li>Playing Guitar</li></p>
        <p><li>Drawing</li></p>
        <p><li>Sleeping</li></p>
        <p><li>Reading</li></p>
    </ol>
    
    <p>My favorite quote of all time:</p>

    <blockquote>"The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The meaning of life is to <strong>give your gift away"</strong></blockquote>
    <h2>- William Shakespeare</h2>
