        <h1>My Interets - Table Tennis</h1>
        <p>Table tennis or also known as ping-pong is a ball game that similar with tennis, the difference is ping-pong played on a flat table divided into two equal courts by a net. Using small rackets and light balls, this sport has a long history and has a reputation as one of the most intense and strategic sports.</p>
        <p>I fell in love with ping-pong since the first time I played this game in 2021. Even though it looks simple, for me ping-pong is very unique, it's more than just a game. It taught me the importance of focus, the significance of resilience, adaptability and also perseverence.</p>
