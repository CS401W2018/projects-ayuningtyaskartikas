            <dd><p>The inline CSS also known as style attributes is when the attributes/property is inside the opening tag, For our final project we not gonna use this. 
            <br><br> Embedded CSS also known as style tag, it's put between the open and close style tag
            <br><br> The external CSS is when we use external CSS file and link it to our html file.</dd></dl></p>
        <dt><h4>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h4></dt>
            <dd><p>This is the one that is recommended for us to use, because it's more effective, one css file can be use for the more than one pages that we have (make it cohesive).</p></dd>
        <dt><h4>What is a selector used for?</h4></dt>
            <dd><p>The selector is used to select which section from our page that we want the style to be applied (we gonna discuss this more in the next class).</p></dd>
