    <h2> &#127812; Internet</h2>
    <p><i>A global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols to exchange data. It includes services like email, file sharing, and the World Wide Web (WWW).</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; Web</h2>
    <p><i>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia content that can be accessed via the Internet using a browser. It's a way of accessing information on the Internet.</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p><i>The Internet is the physical network of computers and servers, while the Web is a service that runs on the Internet, enabling access to websites and content through browsers.</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p><i>(American Standard Code for Information Interchange): A character encoding standard that represents text in computers, using 7-bit binary codes to represent characters (like letters, numbers, and symbols). A character encoding standard that aims to cover all the world's writing systems, using variable-length encoding (like UTF-8) to represent characters in different languages and symbols.</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; What is UTF-8</h2>
    <p><i>A widely used encoding in Unicode that uses 1 to 4 bytes for each character, allowing it to represent any character in the Unicode standard, while maintaining compatibility with ASCII.
    </i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; URL</h2>
    <p><i>(Uniform Resource Locator): The address used to locate a resource on the Internet, typically consisting of a protocol (e.g., http), domain, and path (e.g., http://example.com/index.html).</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; Domain Name</h2>
    <p><i>A human-readable address for a website or service on the Internet, such as example.com, which corresponds to an IP address.</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; HTTP</h2>
    <p><i>(HyperText Transfer Protocol): The protocol used for transferring web pages and resources over the Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between clients (browsers) and servers.</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; HTTPS</h2>
    <p><i>(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure): The secure version of HTTP, which encrypts data transmitted between the browser and the web server using SSL/TLS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; IP Address</h2>
    <p><i>(Internet Protocol Address): A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network, enabling them to communicate over the Internet. It can be IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.0.1) or IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; DNS</h2>
    <p><i>(Domain Name System): A system that translates domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses, allowing browsers to find and connect to websites.</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p><i>Standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure the Web remains accessible, interoperable, and open. These include HTML, CSS, and other web technologies.</i></p>
    <h2>&#127812; XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p><i>(eXtensible Markup Language): A flexible, text-based format for representing structured data, used to store and transport data between systems. (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language): A stricter version of HTML that follows XML rules, making it more consistent and ensuring proper document structure. (HyperText Markup Language): The standard language used to create and structure web pages by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. The latest version of HTML, introducing new elements and APIs to support modern web applications (e.g., multimedia, offline storage, and improved accessibility).</i></p>
