            <li><p>What is normal flow in HTML?</p></li>
                <p>>> The main elements demand more space of the page than the other. There is an order vertically (example H2 is higher than p tag).</p>
            <li><p>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</p></li>
                <p>>> Float takes an element out of the normal flow, it can align to left or right. We need clear the float to prevent elements from overlapping.</p>
            <li><p>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</p></li>
                <p>>> Absolute (you can still scroll it, but it's consistent, example : button for live chat on the right below of an website). an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, fixed the elements doesn't scroll (it's just stay there, example: the header on the top of the website). The relative moves an element relative to its normal position.</p>
            <li><p>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</p></li>
                <p>>> We can make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices by using CSS, by adding attribute to the nav tag.</p>
            <li><p>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</p></li>
                <p>>> We can find the videos to review what we talked in class on Canvas. It's on the 'Lecture Notes' under the module of this week.</p>
